### **Customer Churn Prediction**
Customer churn is the rate at which customers stop using a particular service or product, it is essential for a business to conduct surveys and understand when customers are likely to leave and take steps that would keep them. The customer churn model illustrated below identifies those at risk of leaving.

The following highlights the steps a data scientist would follow to creat amodel that predicts when customers are likely to leave. The info contained in the dataset is as follows 
    Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
    Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
    Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
    Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.


#### **Step 1. Objectives**
Definition of the problem and what it seeks to achieve, what leads to customers to cancel their subscription, where do they go and what optionsa re available for them.

### ** Step 2. Data Collection**
Collection of all data that would be relevant to predict customer churn, make the dataset as comprehensive as possible.

### **Step 3. Data preprocessing**
Clean the data, address missing values, extreme outliers etc

### **Step 4. Perform Exploratory data analysis**
Explore the data to discover patterns, trends and relationship to understand the data before modelling starts.

### **Step 5. Split data into training and testing sets**
Split the data into training and testing sets, the purpose is to allow the data to learn on new unseen data and see how it perfoms.

### **Step 6. Train the data**
Select the machine learning model and select and tune it to optimize the hyperparameters.

### **Step 7. Evaluate the model
The model should be evaluated using appropriate metrics
Make improvements.

### **Step 8. Test and deploy the model
Test to assess the accuracy of the model on new unseen data in a production environment. Deploy into production.
